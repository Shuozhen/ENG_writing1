### Topic: Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subjects.
It seems that the sex ratio in universities has been a hot topic for a long time. While students are making fun of the hard tasks of finding a girlfriend or a boyfriend, the serious issue whether universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject has caught raised people’s attention. For the people who agree with the issue, they under this circumstance, some people believe that both genders should have the same right to receive advanced education. At the same time, people who hold the opposite view claim that gender should not be a determinant of the university admission. From my personal perspective, I think it is unnecessary and un realistic for all universities to accept equal numbers of men and women in all subjects.
First of all, there is no need to consider the proportion of the genders when enrolling the students. Whether a student should be admitted to a certain major in a certain university ought to be based on this student’s ability and potential on this subject rather than whether the student is a man or a woman. Accepting equal number of male and female ss ignore their competence in xxxxxand xxx, thus it is irrational to ….Thus, the confinement on the sex ratio not only do no contribution to the students’ quality in certain subject, but also will raise the risk of losing truly fitted students due to the restriction.
Besides, it  is hardly possibble 为什么for all the subjects in all universities to accept equal male and female students. We cannot ignore the fact that men and women are born with differences, both physically and mentally. In generally speaking, males do better at logic, mathematics, strength and so on than females, while females are better at art, language, psychology, suppleness and so on. Naturally， people will do better job in their skilled field and therefore be more willing to do so, tThat’s the reason why men tend to apply for subjects like engineering or sciences, while women are more likely to learn art or literature. So the sex ratio of applicants for each subject are not just right at 50% male to 50% female. It is difficult or even impossible for an engineering major to have the same number of men and women, since maybe only men apply for it.
Though there may be some benefits to have equal males and females in the same subject, such as increasing some people support the xxx because the opportunities for both genders to learn how to get along with each other and being a symbol of elimination of sex discrimination and equal rights to get education, 这些问题相比于他们的学习是可以忽略的I do think forcing an engineering subject to have women as many as men and for this aim even seting a special bar of scores for minority will hurt the equality eventually. The best way to solve this problem is fair competition between male and female students.

In my conclusion, it’s ridiculous and non-sense to enforce every subject in every university to accept equal number of males and females. ，Because fair competition and equal respect to both genders are the most important when a university is selecting its students.
