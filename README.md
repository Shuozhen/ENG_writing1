### Topic: Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.

The university is vital to education, just as education to society. Thus whether universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject's admission really matters. Under such circumstance, some people with the issue insisting that both genders should have the same right to receive advanced education. From my perspective, it is ridiculous and non-sense to enforce every subject in every university to accept equal number of males and females.

First of all, enforcing universities to have same number of men and women students will ruin the right for students get higher education. whether a student should be admitted to a certain major in a certain university ought to be based on this student’s ability and potential on this subject rather than whether the student is a man or a woman. Accepting equal number of male and female ss ignore their competence in xxxxxand xxx, thus it is irrational to ….Thus, the confinement on the sex ratio not only do no contribution to the students’ quality in certain subject, but also will raise the risk of losing truly fitted students due to the restriction.

Besides, it will lose talents for the society. We cannot ignore the fact that men and women are born with differences, both physically and mentally. In generally speaking, males do better at logic, mathematics, strength and so on than females, while females are better at art, language, psychology, suppleness and so on. Naturally， people will do better job in their skilled field and therefore be more willing to do so, tThat’s the reason why men tend to apply for subjects like engineering or sciences, while women are more likely to learn art or literature. So the sex ratio of applicants for each subject are not just right at 50% male to 50% female. It is difficult or even impossible for an engineering major to have the same number of men and women, since maybe only men apply for it.

Though there may be some benefits to have equal males and females in the same subject, such as increasing some people support the xxx because the opportunities for both genders to learn how to get along with each other and being a symbol of elimination of sex discrimination and equal rights to get education, 这些问题相比于他们的学习是可以忽略的I do think forcing an engineering subject to have women as many as men and for this aim even seting a special bar of scores for minority will hurt the equality eventually. The best way to solve this problem is fair competition between male and female students.

In my conclusion, it’s . ，Because fair competition and equal respect to both genders are the most important when a university is selecting its students.
